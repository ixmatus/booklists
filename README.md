# `booklists`

A repository for all of the book recommendation lists I find interesting and
notable and controversial and worth considering. I started this project in order
to "keep my hands busy" because I generate obsessive compulsive psychic energy
too easily when it comes to books and lists of books and I have a tendency to
buy books far faster than I read them.

This project should help direct my energies to a more productive and less
consumptive end with the intention that I have an "essential set" of books taken
from the intersection of all the lists that I add here and that essential set I
should focus my limited purchasing power and reading time on (with a random
sampling of books from lists that have no intersections for a bit of balance).

Most lists get published on the internet in a format that I find difficult to
consume programmatically. This project intends to fix that, to make this
information as open as possible.
